Action Painting Demo Apps:

Here's a few techniques I used to collect shapes from action film sequences for an artwork called Action Painting.

Action Painting is a series of animated paintings in the style of Jackson Pollock composed using sampled shapes and sounds from action flicks as material.

You can view the videos at http://mantissa.ca/projects/actionpainting.php

01_ColorPicking demonstrates how to use openCV to extract and save shapes of a specific color using a rotoscope-like technique
02_MovieColorTracking demonstrates how to track colors within the frames of movies to create painterly animations
03_MovieColorTracking demonstrates how to track movement within the frames of movies to create painterly animations
04_WeightedBezier demonstrates how to create Bezier curves using shapes extracted using openCV

These apps were made with OpenFrameworks and require version 0.71 to compile: http://www.openframeworks.cc/download
